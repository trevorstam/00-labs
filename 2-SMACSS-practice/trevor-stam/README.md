##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)
I put all the general css rules for the general elements in the base.css.
The layout elements such as navs, footers, asides were put in layout.css.
The remaining elements mainly with ID's, classes or generally small elements were classified as modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(Put your answer here)
No, generally the Chocolate Pizza looked like Chocolate Pizza, so I didn't have to do any refactoring
